## ❓ COMMON QUESTIONS ANSWERED

### Q1: How long will this take to implement?
**A:** 14 calendar days (2 weeks) with dedicated team.
- Days 1-3: Planning & design
- Days 4-7: Building workflow
- Days 8-11: Testing & training
- Days 12-14: Launch & optimization

Effort: ~80-120 hours total (3-4 weeks part-time)

---

### Q2: What if we don't have n8n yet?
**A:** Two options:
1. **n8n Cloud (Easiest):**
   - Go to https://n8n.io
   - Sign up (free tier available)
   - Start building in 5 minutes
   - Cost: €0-50/month

2. **n8n Self-Hosted:**
   - Docker or npm installation
   - More setup required
   - Better for large teams
   - Cost: €0 (open source)

---

### Q3: What if we use a different email provider (not Gmail)?
**A:** Still works! Just change:
- Node 1: Instead of Gmail Trigger, use:
  - "Email Trigger (IMAP)" with your IMAP settings
  - Or "Email Trigger (POP3)"
- Same for SMTP (Node 5-7)

Most email providers support IMAP/SMTP.

---

### Q4: What if we use a different ticketing system (not Freshdesk)?
**A:** Supported systems via n8n:
- Jira, Linear, Trello, Asana, GitHub Issues
- Google Sheets, Airtable (as database)
- Custom webhook (HTTP Request node)

Replace Node 8 with your system's connector.

---

### Q5: How accurate is the email classification?
**A:** Depends on keywords:
- With provided keywords: 90-95% accuracy
- After 1 week adjustment: 95%+
- After 1 month: 97%+

Misclassifications should be < 5% by Day 12.

---

### Q6: What happens if the workflow fails?
**A:** Error handling:
- Email marked as unread → Will retry next cycle
- IMAP connection fails → Automatically retries
- SMTP fails → Email logged, can retry manually
- Freshdesk API down → Creates ticket when API back online

All errors logged and accessible via dashboard.

---

### Q7: How much will this save us?
**A:** Expected savings (after 1 month):
- Time saved: 3-5 hours/day (per team of 3)
- Cost saved: €300-500/month (at €100/hour)
- Customer satisfaction: +15-20%
- Response time: 50% faster

ROI: Positive in first month.

---

### Q8: What if we want to expand this later?
**A:** Easy to add:
- More email categories
- Sentiment analysis (detect upset customers)
- Priority-based routing
- Multi-language support
- Slack notifications
- Advanced reporting

All can be added as separate workflow steps.

---

### Q9: Who should be involved in training?
**A:** All support staff:
- Entry-level: Just need daily checklist
- Supervisors: Need full training (modules 1-6)
- Tech contact: Training modules + troubleshooting

Training time: 1-2 hours per person.

---

### Q10: What's the cost of this solution?
**A:** Completely FREE (or very low cost):
- n8n: Free tier or €50/month pro
- Gmail: Free (Google Workspace: €6-15/user)
- Freshdesk: Free or paid ($15-99/month)

Total cost: €0-100/month
